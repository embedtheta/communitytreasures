<p>'Q-space' can also be used to participate in our income opportunity. </p>
<p>By completing a few daily tasks, your 'Q-space' acts like a capsule, moving up a digital frame work that we call 'The Queue'.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="goal-abt">
<h3>What is 'The Queue'.</h3>
<div class="abt-goal-right">
<div style="float: left; width: 67%;"><p> The Queue connects every Q-space on our platform and gives you the option to become a 'CT Brand Builder' in our income Opportunity.</p>
<p>As a 'CT Brand Builder', you are agreeing to be hired as an independent freelance marketer, giving your 'time and effort' to help  build and promote our fledgling in-house brands.</p>
<p>Your requirements will be to watch 12 of our in-house ads for 12 seconds each, then complete 1 small task, such as, posting one of our brand marketing videos on social media.</p></div>
<img src="http://www.communitytreasures.co/images/ctquespc.jpeg" alt="" style="float: right;">
<br class="clr" />
<p>The process must be done daily and can take as little as Seven (7) minutes to complete.</p> 
<p>This activity is recorded in 'The Queue' which acts like a digital clocking-in system. Just like a traditional time clock, 'The Queue' tells us how many days you have completed these daily tasks and once this is confirmed, you move up a position in the queue.</p> 
<p>When you reach the top of a queue, your efforts are added up and you are rewarded for your time and services.</p>
<p>There are five different queues called Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5. </p>
<p>Linked like conveyer belts, these digital queues enable you to promote any one of our 30 plus fledgling brands in various industries as you move towards payments and generous bonuses that are rewarded for completing your daily actions.</p>
<p>After you moved up through all five queues, you have the option to purchase more 'Q-space and continue hiring your services to us as you go around the system again. This is called completing a Life Cycle and will only be offered when you reach the very <br />end of Q5'.<br />
By continuing to work up the queues, you claim further bonuses, rewards and other opportunities offered by each of our in-house brands.</p>
<p>To qualify to become a brand builder you must be 18 years old or more and have an account on at least one (1) social network, (similar to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn etc.).</p>
<p>Please Note: You are responsible for paying your own taxes and declaring any payments received from CT.</p>
